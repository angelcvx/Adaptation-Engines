# Leagues of the World app

Leagues of the World is an application for sport reports consulting. This application exemplify one scenario in which the number of data/functionality requests and amount of information displayed on the screen is adapted according to the user profile. Examples of applications with this behavior are instant messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp, Telegram), newspapers and weather apps, sport reports apps (e.g., LiveScore, DAZN), and market places (e.g., Play Store). The energy consumption of these kinds of applications can be reduced significantly if they only request and show the information which is relevant to the user.

This repository contains a basic implementation of the Leagues of the World app (without any daptation engine), as well as other four implementations using different adaptation engines.
