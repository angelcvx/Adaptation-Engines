# Feather Video app

Feather Video is an application for video compression and sending. This application exemplifies the scenario in which the application is adapted according to the known user profile by introducing a new functionality (or adapting an existing one). In this application, the user can select a video from the gallery in order to compress and, optionally, sending it. The adaptation in this case consists of selecting the compression algorithm taking into account the device context. Examples of applications with this behavior are aocial apps (e.g., Facebook, Instagram), e-mail clients (e.g., Gmail, Microsoft Outlook), videoconference apps (e.g., Skype, Hangouts), or Google Photos.

This repository contains a basic implementation of the Feather Video app (without any daptation engine), as well as other four implementations using different adaptation engines.
